## Test1

** From a command-line specified text file, read a sequence of possibly whitespace-separated (name,value) pairs, where the name is a single whitespace-separated word and the value is an integer or a floating-point value. 

 Your program should define at least the following functions:

（1）main()，this function checks the command-line argument, gets the file path from which all name-value pairs are read, and call following functions.

（2）compute(), this function computes and print the sum and average for each name and the sum and average for all names. *Hint: §6.1.8*.**
